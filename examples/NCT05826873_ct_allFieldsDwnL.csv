NCT05826873,Discharge Stewardship in Children's Hospitals,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05826873,DISCO,ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING,"The goal of this interventional study is to test if a discharge stewardship bundle is effective at reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions at hospital discharge for children with the three common infections: community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), urinary tract infections (UTI), and skin/soft tissue infections (SSTI). The goals of this study are:

* To develop, locally adapt, and implement a discharge stewardship intervention across four geographically diverse children's hospitals.
* To measure the impact of the discharge stewardship intervention on antibiotic prescribing and patient outcome for three common pediatric infections.

Families who are enrolled in the study will be asked to:

* complete a one question wellness track on days 3, 7, and 21 after hospital discharge
* complete a brief survey on days 7 and 21 after hospital discharge

The study team will conduct interviews with the hospitalists at each of the four participating hospitals to create a ""discharge stewardship"" bundle. Once the bundle intervention is implemented, the hospitalists will be asked to follow prescribing guidelines for CAP, UTI, and SSTI. They will receive regular group-level feedback reports to show how well they follow the guidelines and motivate the hospitalists to follow the guidelines better.",NO,"Pneumonia, Bacterial|Pneumonia Childhood|Urinary Tract Infections|Soft Tissue Infections|Skin Infections|Community-acquired Pneumonia",BEHAVIORAL: Discharge antibiotic stewardship intervention,"Rate of suboptimal prescribing, The primary objective of this study is to determine the impact of a discharge stewardship intervention on antibiotic prescribing and patient outcomes for three common pediatric infection after developing and implementing the intervention across four geographically diverse children's hospitals. Impact will be measured by the rate of suboptimal prescribing (drug, dose, route, and duration) for CAP, UTI, and SSTI across the four hospitals. Suboptimal prescribing will be measured using data collected from the electronic health record. The discharge prescription data (choice and duration) will be compared to the recommended guidelines to determine if the discharge prescription was on or off guideline., up to 3 years","Impact of the discharge stewardship intervention on post-discharge treatment failure, Using a quasi-experimental design, the study team will assess the rate and trajectory of post-discharge treatment failure for CAP, UTI, and SSTI via patient report (post-discharge REDCap surveys), up to 3 years|Impact of the discharge stewardship intervention on adverse drug events, Using a quasi-experimental design, the study team will assess the rate and trajectory of adverse drug events for CAP, UTI, and SSTI via patient report (post-discharge REDCap surveys), up to 3 years",,Children's Hospital of Philadelphia,Seattle Children's Hospital|Primary Children's Hospital|St. Louis Children's Hospital|University of Pennsylvania|Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ),ALL,"CHILD, ADULT",NA,1131,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: OTHER,20-017269|R01HS027428-01,2020-06-10,2024-12-31,2025-07,2023-04-24,,2025-01-13,"St. Louis Children's Hospital, Saint Louis, Missouri, 63110, United States|Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19104, United States|University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19104, United States|Primary Children's Hospital, Salt Lake City, Utah, 84113, United States|Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington, 98105, United States","Informed Consent Form: Patient Consent, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/73/NCT05826873/ICF_000.pdf|Informed Consent Form: Clinician Verbal Consent, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/73/NCT05826873/ICF_001.pdf"
