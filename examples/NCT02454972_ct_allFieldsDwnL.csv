NCT02454972,Clinical Trial of Lurbinectedin (PM01183) in Selected Advanced Solid Tumors,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02454972,,COMPLETED,"Multicenter, open-label, exploratory, phase II clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PM01183 in previously treated patients with advanced solid tumors",YES,Advanced Solid Tumors,DRUG: lurbinectedin (PM01183),"Overall Response Rate (ORR), Overall Response Rate was defined as the percentage of patients with a confirmed response, either CR or PR, according to the RECIST v.1.1. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response (PR): ≥30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions compared with baseline; Progressive disease: ≥20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions compared with the smallest-sum longest; diameter recorded or the appearance of one or more new lesions; Stable Disease: Neither PR or PD, From the start of treatment to the date of progression or the start of a subsequent therapy or end of patient's follow-up, until Cycle 6 (21-day cycle)|Response by Investigator Assessment, When response is the primary endpoint, and thus all patients must have measurable disease to enter the trial, all patients included in the study must be accounted for in the report of the results, even if there are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are not evaluable. Each patient will be assigned one of the following: Complete Response: Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response: ≥30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions; Progressive disease: ≥20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; diameter recorded or the appearance of one or more new lesions; Stable Disease: Neither PR or PD; Inevaluable for response: specify reasons (for example: early death, malignant disease, toxicity; tumour assessments not repeated/incomplete; other).

Normally, all eligible patients should be included in the denominator for the calculation of the response rate for phase II trials., From the start of treatment to the date of progression or the start of a subsequent therapy or end of patient's follow-up, until Cycle 6 (21-day cycle)","Duration of Response, Duration of Response by Investigator's Assessment, defined as the time between the date when the response criteria (PR or CR, whichever one is first reached) are fulfilled to the first date when disease progression (PD), recurrence or death is documented., From the start of treatment to the date of progression or the start of a subsequent therapy or end of patient's follow-up, until Cycle 6 (21-day cycle)|Clinical Benefit, Clinical Benefit Rate was defined as Overall Response Rate or Stable Disease lasting over four months (SD ≥ 4 months), From the start of treatment to the date of progression or the start of a subsequent therapy or end of patient's follow-up, until Cycle 6 (21-day cycle)|Disease Control Rate, Disease Control Rate was defined as Overall Response Rate or Stable Disease, From the start of treatment to the date of progression or the start of a subsequent therapy or end of patient's follow-up, until Cycle 6|Progression Free Survival (PFS), Progression-free Survival (PFS), defined as the period of time from the date of first infusion to the date of PD, death (of any cause), or last tumor evaluation.

Progressive disease: ≥20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions compared with the smallest-sum longest, From the date of first infusion to the date of progression disease, death (of any cause), or last tumor evaluation, up to an average of 5 years|Progression-free Survival at 4 Months, Progression-free Survival at 4, defined as the probability of being free from progression and death after the first infusion at 4 months. Progressive disease: ≥20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions compared with the smallest-sum longest, At 4 months|Progression-free Survival at 6 Months, Progression-free Survival at 6, defined as the probability of being free from progression and death after the first infusion at 6 months. Progressive disease: ≥20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions compared with the smallest-sum longest, At 6 months|Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival defined as the period of time from the date of first infusion to the date of death or last contact in case of patients lost to follow-up or alive at the clinical cutoff established for the cohort., From the date of first infusion to the date of death or last contact, up to an average of 5 years|Overall Survival at 6 Months, Overall Survival at 6 months defined as the probability of being alive after the first infusion at 6 months, At 6 months|Overall Survival at 12 Months, Overall Survival at 12 months defined as the probability of being alive after the first infusion at 12 months, At 12 months",,PharmaMar,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,345,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,PM1183-B-005-14,2015-08-25,2020-09-18,2020-09-18,2015-05-27,2021-11-22,2023-03-02,"Sarcoma Oncology Research Center, LLC, Santa Monica, California, 90403, United States|University of Colorado Cancer Center, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States|Massachussets General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, 02114, United States|Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, United States|Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, United States|The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States|Institute for Drug Development, Cancer Therapy & Research Center at University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, Texas, 78229, United States|Institut Jules Bordet, Brussels, 1000, Belgium|Hôpital Cochin, Paris, 75014, France|Institut Claudius Regaud, Toulouse, 31059, France|Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, 94805, France|Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin - Campus Benjamin Franklin - Comprehensive Cancer Center, Berlin, 12200, Germany|Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, 13353, Germany|Istituto Clinico Humanitas, Rozzano, Milan, 20089, Italy|Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, Bologna, Italy|lstituto Europeo di Oncologia, Milano, 20141, Italy|ASST Monza - Ospedale San Gerardo di Monza Struttura Complessa di Oncologia Medica, Monza, 20090, Italy|AUSL Romagna - Ospedale Santa Maria delle Croci, Ravenna, 48121, Italy|Complexo Hospitalario Universitario de Santiago, Santiago de Compostela, A Coruña, 15706, Spain|Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Oviedo, Asturias, 33011, Spain|Hopsital Universitario Donostia - Donostia Unibertsitate Ospitalea, San Sebastián, Guipúzcoa, 20014, Spain|Hospital Universitario Puerta de Hierro Majadahonda, Majadahonda, Madrid, 28222, Spain|Complejo Hospitalario De Navarra, Pamplona, Navarra, 31008, Spain|Hospital Universitario Álvaro Cunqueiro, Vigo, Pontevedra, 36312, Spain|Hospital de Basurto, Bilbao, Vizcaya, 48013, Spain|Complexo Hospitalario Universitario A Coruña, A Coruña, 15006, Spain|Hospital Universitari Vall D' Hebron, Barcelona, 08035, Spain|Complejo Hospitalario Regional Reina Sofía, Cordoba, 14004, Spain|Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves, Granada, 18014, Spain|Hospital Ramón y Cajal, Madrid, 28034, Spain|Hospital Universitario Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Madrid, 28040, Spain|Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid, 28041, Spain|Hospital Universitario Madrid Sanchinarro, Madrid, 28050, Spain|Complejo Hospitalario de Especialidades Virgen de la Victoria, Malaga, 29010, Spain|Hospital Universitari i Polotècnic la Fe, Valencia, 46026, Spain|Hospital Universitario Miguel Servet, Zaragoza, 50009, Spain|Skane University Hospital, Lund, 22185, Sweden|Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, Lausanne, Vaud, 1011, Switzerland|Istituto Oncologico della Svizzera Italiana (IOSI), Bellinzona, 6500, Switzerland|UCL Cancer Institute, London, WC1E 6DD, United Kingdom","Study Protocol, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/72/NCT02454972/Prot_002.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/72/NCT02454972/SAP_001.pdf"
