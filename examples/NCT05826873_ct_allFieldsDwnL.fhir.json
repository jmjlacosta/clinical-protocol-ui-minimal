The goals of this study are:\n\n* To develop, locally adapt, and implement a discharge stewardship intervention across four geographically diverse children's hospitals.\n* To measure the impact of the discharge stewardship intervention on antibiotic prescribing and patient outcome for three common pediatric infections.\n\nFamilies who are enrolled in the study will be asked to:\n\n* complete a one question wellness track on days 3, 7, and 21 after hospital discharge\n* complete a brief survey on days 7 and 21 after hospital discharge\n\nThe study team will conduct interviews with the hospitalists at each of the four participating hospitals to create a \"discharge stewardship\" bundle. Once the bundle intervention is implemented, the hospitalists will be asked to follow prescribing guidelines for CAP, UTI, and SSTI. They will receive regular group-level feedback reports to show how well they follow the guidelines and motivate the hospitalists to follow the guidelines better.","description":"Pediatric antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs) in hospital and outpatient settings optimize the use of antibiotics to improve clinical outcomes, decrease adverse drug events, and reduce the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. However, stewardship for patients at the transition from hospital discharge to home, or \"discharge stewardship,\" is an unmet need for several reasons. First, few pediatric stewardship programs perform discharge stewardship. Second, approximately 30% of pediatric patients receive antibiotics at hospital discharge. Third, the majority of antibiotic days prescribed for hospitalized patients occur after discharge. Fourth, up to half of discharge antibiotic prescriptions are suboptimal, which includes choosing the wrong drug, dose, route, or duration of therapy.\n\nThis project will use an implementation science framework to develop, implement, and test the effectiveness of a multifaceted discharge stewardship intervention for hospitalized children with the three most common indications for antibiotic prescribing in hospitalized children - community acquired pneumonia (CAP), urinary tract infections (UTI), and skin/soft tissue infections (SSTI) - at four children's hospitals to establish a foundation for future expansion to additional target populations. Antibiotic choice, dose, route, and duration of therapy will be addressed.\n\nAim 1 is to develop, locally adapt, and implement a discharge stewardship intervention across the four participating sites. The integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework will guide a rapid formative evaluation to identify contextual factors likely to facilitate or hinder the implementation of a discharge stewardship intervention at each site. Based on these results, local facilitators will work to develop and implement a discharge stewardship intervention comprised of consensus driven clinical prescribing guidelines for CAP, UTI, and SSTI plus quarterly feedback of prescribing data based on these guidelines. Aim 2 is to measure the impact of the discharge stewardship intervention on antibiotic prescribing (the primary outcome) and patient-centered balancing measures (post-discharge treatment failure and adverse events).\n\nThis project will form the foundation for future dissemination of discharge stewardship to a broader array of patient populations. Investigators on this proposal form the leadership of the Sharing Antimicrobial Reports for Pediatric Stewardship (SHARPS) Collaborative, a network comprised of more than 60 children's hospitals across North America that is uniquely positioned to adopt antimicrobial stewardship interventions designed to target prescribing at hospital discharge.","site":[{"reference":"#NCT05826873-Location-0","type":"Location"},{"reference":"#NCT05826873-Location-1","type":"Location"},{"reference":"#NCT05826873-Location-2","type":"Location"},{"reference":"#NCT05826873-Location-3","type":"Location"},{"reference":"#NCT05826873-Location-4","type":"Location"}],"classifier":[{"text":"IPDSharing: No"},{"text":"IPDSharingDescription: This study was initiated prior to the NIH Data Management and Sharing Policy update that was released on January 25, 2023."},{"text":"Has Results: False"},{"text":"Oversight Classifier: oversightHasDmc False"},{"text":"Oversight Classifier: isFdaRegulatedDrug False"},{"text":"Oversight Classifier: isFdaRegulatedDevice False"}],"associatedParty":[{"name":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia","role":{"coding":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/research-study-party-role","code":"sponsor","display":"Sponsor"}]},"classifier":[{"coding":[{"system":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-about-studies/study-data-structure#enum-AgencyClass","code":"OTHER","display":"OTHER"}]}]},{"name":"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia","role":{"coding":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/research-study-party-role","code":"lead-sponsor","display":"lead-sponsor"}]},"classifier":[{"coding":[{"system":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-about-studies/study-data-structure#enum-AgencyClass","code":"OTHER","display":"OTHER"}]}]},{"name":"Seattle Children's Hospital","role":{"coding":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/research-study-party-role","code":"collaborator","display":"Collaborator"}]},"classifier":[{"coding":[{"system":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-about-studies/study-data-structure#enum-AgencyClass","code":"OTHER","display":"OTHER"}]}]},{"name":"Primary Children's Hospital","role":{"coding":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/research-study-party-role","code":"collaborator","display":"Collaborator"}]},"classifier":[{"coding":[{"system":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-about-studies/study-data-structure#enum-AgencyClass","code":"OTHER","display":"OTHER"}]}]},{"name":"St. Louis Children's Hospital","role":{"coding":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/research-study-party-role","code":"collaborator","display":"Collaborator"}]},"classifier":[{"coding":[{"system":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-about-studies/study-data-structure#enum-AgencyClass","code":"OTHER","display":"OTHER"}]}]},{"name":"University of Pennsylvania","role":{"coding":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/research-study-party-role","code":"collaborator","display":"Collaborator"}]},"classifier":[{"coding":[{"system":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-about-studies/study-data-structure#enum-AgencyClass","code":"OTHER","display":"OTHER"}]}]},{"name":"Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)","role":{"coding":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/research-study-party-role","code":"collaborator","display":"Collaborator"}]},"classifier":[{"coding":[{"system":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-about-studies/study-data-structure#enum-AgencyClass","code":"FED","display":"FED"}]}]},{"name":"Jeffrey S Gerber, MD, PhD","role":{"coding":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/research-study-party-role","code":"primary-investigator","display":"Primary Investigator"}]},"party":{"display":"Associate Professor, Pediatrics"}}],"progressStatus":[{"state":{"coding":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/research-study-status","code":"active-but-not-recruiting","display":"Active, not recruiting"}]}},{"state":{"coding":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/research-study-status","code":"overall-study","display":"Overall study"}]},"actual":true,"period":{"start":"2020-06-10"}},{"state":{"coding":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/research-study-status","code":"overall-study","display":"Overall study"}]},"actual":false,"period":{"end":"2025-07"}}],"recruitment":{"actualNumber":1131,"eligibility":{"type":"Group","identifier":{"type":{"text":"FEvIR Linking Identifier"},"system":"https://fevir.net/FLI","value":"NCT05826873 Eligibility Criteria","assigner":{"display":"Computable Publishing LLC"}},"display":"NCT05826873 Eligibility Criteria"}},"comparisonGroup":[{"eligibility":{"reference":"#NCT05826873-comparison-group-0","type":"Group","display":"Pediatric Hospitalists: Prescribing physicians and hospital employees will be recruited during regularly held staff meetings prior to the data collection period.
