NCT03927651,ICG to Assess Ovarian Perfusion,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03927651,,COMPLETED,To assess the feasibility of using intravenous ICG to characterize the vascular perfusion of ovaries during gynecologic surgery,NO,Fibroid Uterus|Endometriosis|Uterus Myoma|Uterine Fibroid|Uterine Adenomyosis|Endometrial Cyst|Uterine Cyst,DRUG: ICG,"Assessment of ovarian perfusion after ICG administration via fluorescent imaging, The investigators will be assessing the feasibility of using intravenous ICG to characterize the vascular perfusion of ovaries by imaging. During surgery ICG will be administered intravenously via a peripheral or central line at the direction of the surgeon by the anesthesiologist. The injected amount will be a 3 mL solution of reconstituted ICG that contains a 7.5 mg dose of ICG. This will be followed by a 10 mL bolus of normal saline for injection per the manufacturer's recommendation. The total dose of dye injected should not exceed 2 mg/kg.

Visibility of the ICG fluorescence should occur within 1-2 minutes with a duration of 20-120 minutes., 2 years",,,Northwestern University,,FEMALE,ADULT,EARLY_PHASE1,54,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: DIAGNOSTIC,STU00208846,2019-06-01,2022-11-15,2022-11-15,2019-04-25,,2023-04-18,"259 E Erie - Northwestern, Chicago, Illinois, 60611, United States","Study Protocol, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/51/NCT03927651/Prot_000.pdf|Informed Consent Form, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/51/NCT03927651/ICF_001.pdf"
