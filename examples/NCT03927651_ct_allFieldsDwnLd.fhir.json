surgery","description":"The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of intravenous ICG administration to facilitate assessments of ovarian vascular perfusion. Historically, assessment of ovarian perfusion has been performed visually or via ultrasound with Doppler evaluation. In patients with ovarian endometriomas, evidence of ovarian interstitial microvascular injury has been demonstrated similarly by the presence of low flow and high RI. The use of ICG to evaluate ovarian perfusion specifically has not been reported. The use of ICG for intraoperative perfusion assessment of the ovary could provide more information about the health of the ovary and inform the surgical approach to ovarian pathology.\n\nICG will be injected intravenously to assess ovarian perfusion in the presence or absence (control) of pathology. Near infrared fluorescence imaging will be used to illuminate the ICG. The extent of perfusion will be determined using digital imaging software.","site":[{"reference":"#NCT03927651-Location-0","type":"Location"}],"classifier":[{"text":"Has Results: False"},{"text":"Oversight Classifier: oversightHasDmc True"},{"text":"Oversight Classifier: isFdaRegulatedDrug True"},{"text":"Oversight Classifier: isFdaRegulatedDevice False"},{"text":"Oversight Classifier: isUsExport True"}],"associatedParty":[{"name":"Northwestern University","role":{"coding":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/research-study-party-role","code":"sponsor","display":"Sponsor"}]},"classifier":[{"coding":[{"system":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-about-studies/study-data-structure#enum-AgencyClass","code":"OTHER","display":"OTHER"}]}]},{"name":"Magdy Milad, MD","role":{"coding":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/research-study-party-role","code":"primary-investigator","display":"Primary Investigator"}]},"party":{"reference":"#NCT03927651-ResponsibleParty-0","type":"PractitionerRole"}},{"name":"Northwestern University","role":{"coding":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/research-study-party-role","code":"lead-sponsor","display":"lead-sponsor"}]},"classifier":[{"coding":[{"system":"https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-about-studies/study-data-structure#enum-AgencyClass","code":"OTHER","display":"OTHER"}]}]},{"name":"Magdy Milad, MD,MS","role":{"coding":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/research-study-party-role","code":"primary-investigator","display":"Primary Investigator"}]},"party":{"display":"Northwestern University"}}],"progressStatus":[{"state":{"coding":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/research-study-status","code":"completed","display":"Completed"}]}},{"state":{"coding":[{"system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/research-study-status","code":"overall-study","display":"Overall study"}]},"actual":true,"period":{"start":"2019-06-01","end":"2022-11-15"}}],"recruitment":{"actualNumber":54,"eligibility":{"type":"Group","identifier":{"type":{"text":"FEvIR Linking Identifier"},"system":"https://fevir.net/FLI","value":"NCT03927651 Eligibility Criteria","assigner":{"display":"Computable Publishing LLC"}},"display":"NCT03927651 Eligibility Criteria"}},"comparisonGroup":[{"eligibility":{"reference":"#NCT03927651-comparison-group-0","type":"Group","display":"Administration of ICG: ICG will be injected intravenously to assess ovarian perfusion in the presence or absence (control) of pathology.
